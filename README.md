# Swift Tutorials
## This is not a package, it's just a bunch of tutorials

This project uses [Apple's DocC (Documentation Compiler)](http://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc/) to create a set of SwiftUI tutorials for students.

## Requirements
- Xcode 13.0 (Beta 1)

## Creating DocC
1. Open the `Package.swift` file
2. In the menu bar, Product → Build Documentation
    - Alternatively, if you have the dexterity for it, use ⌘⌃⇧D (Command-Control-Shift-D)
3. The tutorials should open up in the Documentation viewer
